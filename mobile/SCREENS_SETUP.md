## How to Test

```

Then:

- Or scan QR code with Expo Go app on your phone

### 2. Test Authentication

The app will show **LoginScreen** first.

**Test Credentials** (once backend is running):
- Email: `sarah@magicchat.com`
- Password: `password123`

Or create a new account via the **Sign Up** link.

### 3. Test Video Feed

After login, you'll see the **Feed** tab:

- Pull down to refresh
- Tap action buttons to like/comment/share

### 4. Test Profile

Go to **Profile** tab:
- See your user info
- View stats
- Tap logout to return to login screen

## API Integration

All screens are connected to the backend API:

- **Login/Signup**: Saves JWT token to AsyncStorage
- **Feed**: Fetches videos from `/api/feed/for-you`
- **Like**: Posts to `/api/videos/:id/like`
- **Share**: Posts to `/api/videos/:id/share`
- **Profile**: Gets user from auth store

## Backend Requirements

Make sure your backend is running and accessible:

```bash
# Update mobile/.env with your backend URL
EXPO_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://YOUR_IP:8080

# For iOS simulator, use your computer's IP (not localhost)
# Find your IP: ipconfig getifaddr en0
```

- ❌ Search screen
- ❌ Upload video screen
- ❌ Notifications screen

## Styling

- Background: `#000` (black)
- Text: `#fff` (white)
- Accent: `#ff0050` (pink/red)
- Secondary: `#666`, `#999` (grays)

## Notes

- Videos auto-play when scrolled into view
- Only one video plays at a time
- Videos loop automatically
- Navigation switches based on auth state
- All API calls include JWT authentication
- AsyncStorage persists login between sessions

Ready to test! 🚀
